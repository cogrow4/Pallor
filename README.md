# Pallor

A tale of transformation, rejection, and belonging in a world that has forgotten compassion.

## Overview

**Pallor** is an atmospheric/cinematic 2D metroidvania-style adventure where you navigate a dying world as a shapeshifter caught between two forms: human and wolf. Cast out by both species for being neither fully one nor the other, you must survive in a harsh post-apocalyptic landscape and search for the acceptance you've been denied.

## Key Features

### Dual Form Gameplay

- **Wolf Form**: Experience the world in stark monochrome with heightened predator instincts. Ethereal halos reveal living creatures—red for threats, blue for passive beings, amber for the unpredictable. Move with speed and aggression, traverse terrain inaccessible to humans, and break through weakened barriers to discover hidden routes.

- **Human Form**: See the world in muted color, revealing environmental details, safe pathways, and the stories left behind. Engage in precise combat, solve intricate puzzles, manipulate objects, and navigate complex vertical architecture with careful platforming.

- Seamlessly transform between forms with fluid, hand-crafted animation. Each form offers distinct capabilities—wolf for evasion, speed, and traversal; human for combat, precision, and interaction.

### Semi-Open World Exploration

Navigate an interconnected world designed to make you feel lost and alone. Minimal guidance and environmental storytelling create a sense of isolation that mirrors your rejection by both worlds. Learn the maze-like structure through experience, mastering shortcuts and discovering secrets as you understand the logic of this broken place.

### A World in Decay

Explore a hauntingly beautiful post-apocalyptic landscape inspired by Isobelle Carmody's *Obernewtyn*, *Rain World's* crumbling architecture, and the atmospheric desolation of *The Electric State*. Every corner tells a story of what was lost, and what struggles to survive.

### Visual Design

Blending the ethereal, hand-drawn artistry of *Silt* with the expressive character design and atmospheric environments of *Hollow Knight*, **Pallor** creates a unique visual experience that shifts with your transformation. The monochrome wolf vision strips away detail to reveal threats, while human color vision shows environmental clues and safe paths through dangerous ruins.

### Emotional Narrative

- Survival through isolation and rejection
- The search for belonging in a world that fears difference
- A story about finding acceptance when both sides have turned their backs
- Discover the one friend who sees beyond the surface

## Story

Born a mutant with the ability to shift between human and wolf, you belong to neither world. The humans chased you out, fearing what they couldn't understand. The wolves rejected you, repulsed by the scent of humanity that clings to your fur. 

Now, alone in a decaying world where civilization has crumbled and nature has turned hostile, you must forge your own path. Every day is a struggle for survival. Every transformation is a reminder of what you've lost.

But somewhere in this broken world, there is hope. Someone who will see you not as monster or aberration, but as friend.

## Gameplay Mechanics

### Core Transformation System

**Wolf Form Capabilities:**
- Enhanced movement speed for rapid traversal and evasion
- Access to unique terrain (steep inclines, narrow ledges, unstable surfaces)
- Ability to break through weakened barriers (rotted wood, crumbling walls)
- Predator vision: see living creatures through ethereal colored halos even in darkness
  - Red halos = aggressive threats
  - Blue halos = passive creatures
  - Amber halos = unpredictable mutants
- Lower profile allows sneaking past certain hazards
- Primary use: scouting, evasion, and discovering alternate routes

**Human Form Capabilities:**
- Precise combat with weapons and tools
- Environmental interaction (climb ladders, operate mechanisms, push/pull objects)
- Read environmental storytelling (faded text, symbols, warnings)
- Color vision reveals safe vs. dangerous platforms and pathways
- Careful platforming through complex vertical architecture
- Primary use: combat encounters, puzzle-solving, and navigating treacherous ruins

### Interconnected World Design

- Compact but dense semi-open world structure inspired by *Rain World* and *Hollow Knight*
- Minimal UI and guidance—discover the world's logic through exploration and experimentation
- Environmental storytelling through decaying buildings, abandoned settlements, and remnants of civilization
- Multiple routes between areas accessible through different forms
- Getting lost is intentional—learn the maze through experience

### Combat & Evasion

- Human form for deliberate, tactical combat encounters
- Wolf form for threat assessment and escape strategies
- Scout ahead as wolf to identify enemy positions and types via halos
- Choose your approach: transform to fight, or find a wolf-accessible route around danger
- Dynamic encounters with strange mutated creatures, each with unique animations and behaviors

### Environmental Challenges

- Crumbling architecture creates constant environmental hazards
- Color-coded platforms in human form show structural stability
- Wolf form reveals threats but limits environmental awareness
- Transform mid-movement to access both forms' traversal abilities
- Physics-based challenges requiring understanding of both forms' strengths

### Atmospheric Audio

- Rich soundscape emphasizing isolation and danger
- Audio cues guide exploration and warn of threats
- Music and sound design integral to emotional narrative

## Inspired By

- **Isobelle Carmody's Obernewtyn Chronicles and The Kingdom of the Lost Series** - Post-apocalyptic survival and mutation themes

- **Hollow Knight** - Expressive character animation, atmospheric exploration, and masterful sound design
- **Silt** - Monochromatic art direction and surreal environments (primary art style influence)
- **Planet of Lana** - Companion-focused emotional storytelling and cinematic presentation
- **The Electric State** - Post-apocalyptic environmental design and decay
